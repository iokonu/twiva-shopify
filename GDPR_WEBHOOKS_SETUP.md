https://your-ngrok-url.ngrok-free.app/api/webhooks/customers/data_request

Customer data erasure endpoint:  
https://your-ngrok-url.ngrok-free.app/api/webhooks/customers/redact

Shop data erasure endpoint:
https://your-ngrok-url.ngrok-free.app/api/webhooks/shop/redact
```

### Step 3: Update URLs for Production
When deploying to production, replace the ngrok URLs with your production domain:

```
https://your-production-domain.com/api/webhooks/customers/data_request
https://your-production-domain.com/api/webhooks/customers/redact
https://your-production-domain.com/api/webhooks/shop/redact
```

## üîí Security Features

All endpoints include:
- **HMAC verification** using Shopify webhook secrets
- **Request method validation** (POST only)
